System Architecture

The AgriConnect-MRV platform is designed to be a farmer-friendly, scalable web application integrating AI, real-time data, and official verification workflows.

1. User Layer

Farmers: Upload farm images, receive crop health analysis, crop suggestions, notifications, and government scheme updates.

Officials: Verify farmer submissions, monitor data for MRV reporting and carbon credit assessments.

2. Application Layer (Streamlit Web App)

Frontend: Streamlit UI with high-contrast, intuitive interface, input forms, navigation buttons, and real-time updates.

Backend Logic:

AI models process farm images for crop detection and disease recognition.

Weather and market APIs provide real-time data for crop suggestions.

Notifications module sends alerts for government schemes and modern techniques.

Verification workflow for officials to approve/reject farmer submissions.

3. Data Layer

Local Storage / CSV: Stores farmer submissions, crop data, and verification results.

AI Models: Pretrained PyTorch models for crop detection and disease recognition.

External APIs:

Weather API (Open-Meteo) for real-time climate data.

Optional crop market API for profitability suggestions.

4. Workflow Overview

Farmer logs in â†’ uploads farm image â†’ selects region and crop type.

AI analyzes image â†’ provides crop type, health status, and disease detection.

Weather & regional data â†’ system suggests optimal crop to plant.

Notifications module â†’ sends updates on government schemes & modern techniques.

Official logs in â†’ verifies submissions â†’ MRV data is recorded for reporting.

5. Scalability & Extensibility

Can integrate more AI models for multiple crop types and diseases.

Additional APIs for market trends, soil data, and satellite imagery.

Multi-language support for wider farmer adoption.
